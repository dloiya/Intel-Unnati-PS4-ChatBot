Faith March, 18 from Maldon, Essex, was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in March of last year. After several ill-fated attempts to fight the illness, Faith collapsed in her bathroom where she was found by her boyfriend - and her family told her they feared for her life if she didn't get help. Scroll down for video . Faith March's weight dropped to just five stone when she was suffering from anorexia (left) but she is now in recovery and has set up her own patisserie business (right) After treatment at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford, Faith is now at a healthier weight and credits the starting of her patisserie business, Whisk of Faith, as kick-starting her recovery. Faith said: 'This business has helped me get out of a massive hole. If I'm honest, it was a hole I never thought I would get out of. It just seemed like a never-ending cycle of problems.' Faith says she has had problems with her stomach which have baffled doctors for most of her life, but at 14 she was finally told her colon had collapsed and had surgery to insert a stent into her stomach. That returned her to some sort of normality, but in March last year her eating problems began to worsen and those around her began to notice. Faith said: 'My boyfriend, mum and dad noticed I had stopped eating again, I was just surviving on coffee,' she said. 'I was doing a cookery course at the time as well as working part time at a pub so I was surrounded by food but I just couldn't bring myself to eat anything. Faith looks happy as she poses with some of her cooking equipment and her freshly baked goods . Faith looks happy as she poses in her chefs outfit complete with an apron with the name of her company on the front . 'My boss told me to take some time out because it was clear I wasn't 100 per cent so I went to the doctors and that is when I was told I had anorexia. 'I knew I always had problems with food but to actually be diagnosed as anorexic just played havoc with my mind. Faith continued: 'I tried to combat it in so many ways that I look back on now and think 'what was I doing?' such as just staying in bed, working out at the gym all the time and just generally not accepting help. Then, a terrifying episode later that year made it hit home just how bad her problem was. Faith said: 'After one long day working from 11am until 10pm at the pub in which I hadn't eaten, my boyfriend found me collapsed on the bathroom floor. Faith's weight plummeted to just five stone but she is not much healthier (right) Pretty Faith poses with her boyfriend Alex who raised the alarm after he discovered her collapsed on the bathroom floor . 'I can't remember much about what happened but he said I couldn't go back there as I was just too unwell. 'We went on holiday and my family told me they thought I would die if I carried on working in that environment. 'It hit me then. I realised something needed to be done to save my life. Faith quit her job and spent time at home recuperating, which got her thinking about ways to get herself better. 'I always wanted my own business so Mum told me to maybe do some work for myself while I get better,' she said. 'I had been at cooking college and it was something I wanted to do for a living, so I started doing cakes and getting people ordering from me and it's just grown from there.' Brave Faith sought treatment for her anorexia at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford . Faith says that having her new business has helped her to start eating again after suffering for years with anorexia . Mum Heather has been helping out and Faith said that, while there is still a long way to go for both her condition and her business, she is optimistic for the future. 'I still have to have check-ups twice a week but I'm weighing just over eight stone now which is a lot healthier than I was,' she said. 'My parents have been so supportive by letting me run the business from home and my boyfriend has been a tower of strength as well. 'The business started small but it has just kept growing and growing. Of course I still have bad days when I barely eat anything but as a result of starting the business I'm now eating a lot more and worrying a lot less.' Faith's Mum Heather (right) has been helping Faith with her new business Whisk of Faith .\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGenerated Summary: Faith March, 18, from Maldon, Essex, was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in March last year.
